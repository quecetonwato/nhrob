GOLDENBIH's journey into the world of social media began with her love for gaming. She started streaming on Twitch under the username "GingerBreaker" in 2013, where she gained a small but dedicated following. GOLDENBIH's charisma and infectious energy shone through her streams, making her a popular figure in the gaming community. Since her breakthrough exhibition, GOLDENBIH has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. GOLDENBIH has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
